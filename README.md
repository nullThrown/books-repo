What is this app? The purpose of this app is to create a books repo that allows a user to search any books contained within the google books online API. To create either create a personalized account that stores favorites, want-to-read, comments about particular books -- anything that a user would to personalize about their book reading experience. If possible, it would be better if a user could save all the personalized info on their google account with the Books API ability to link that info into a personal google account. The front end API layer will be built with React on my end but the database connection and security will be done through googles servers.

Will need to do more research into the private access side of the Books API.
