  "description": "What is this app? The purpose of this app is to create a books repo that allows a user to search any books contained within the google books online API. To create either create a personalized account that stores favorites, want-to-read, comments about particular books -- anything that a user would to personalize about their book reading experience. If possible, it would be better if a user could save all the personalized info on their google account with the Books API ability to link that info into a personal google account. The front end API layer will be built with React on my end but the database connection and security will be done through googles servers.",
